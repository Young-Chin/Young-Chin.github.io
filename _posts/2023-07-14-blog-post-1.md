This is a paper collection about Synthetic Image Detection. I'll occasionally update the latest paper from academic websites (most of them from ArXive). For convenience, I'll give a brief introduction about each paper through fast reading. If you want to get the detail, please make a further step.

**[GenImage: A Million-Scale Benchmark for Detecting AI-Generated Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08571)** 

——*Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab*

A new benchmark for generated image detection.

**[Detecting Images Generated by Deep Diffusion Models using their *Local Intrinsic Dimensionality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02347)***

——*Fraunhofer ITWM*

The method called local intrinsic dimensionality(LID) was used to characterize the difference of adversarial samples and natural samples.

**[AI-Generated Image Detection using a Cross-Attention Enhanced Dual-Stream Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07005)**

——*GuangDong Province Key Laboratory of Information Security Technology*

A dual-stream network consists of residual stream and content stream. These two stream could extract the feature of both high and low frequency. Besides, the cross-attention was concated to the dual-stream to enhance the information exchange.

**[HOW TO DETECT UNAUTHORIZED DATA USAGES IN TEXT-TO-IMAGE DIFFUSION MODELS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03108)**

——*Rutgers University, Sony AI*

To protect the copyright from the images generated by unauthorized data, this paper proposed a method that adding unique and imperceptible contents on the image which could plant injected memorization into the diffusion model when trained on these modified data.
