This is a blog to explain the classical linear programming method named ***Simplex Method*** from the question to the inference. Actutally, this report is my final group project of course  ***Advanced Topics in Applied Mathmatics*** advised by Prof . Xiaopin Lu. Our group had finished the topic ***Optimization Algorithm*** with sub-topics as follows.

Here, I just post one of my own parts, which is my most unfamiliar one. In fact, I have learned about Simplex Method before, but haven't well understand the thoery and just know how to compute on the table for passing the exam that time. In addition, when I search for some blogs and literature, sadly I couldn't find some good pages explaining it well from shallow to deep. Therefore, I decided to post my simple and naive report and hope it could help you to get good knowledge about this simple but classical algorithm.
